# BioSphere-OGC

# ./APK

# ./ ProjectOGC
Actual source code of the game.

# What is it?
A game inspired by terraria, with an engine inspired by Mario Zechner's (at-the-time) badLogicGames engine from the book "beginning android games."

All code was written from scratch, one of my first tackles at openGL es. 
This version should have
<li>the chunk system almost ready (buggy when leaving chunk.)</li>
<li>chunk loading system to render only what is on screen</li>
<li>on screen controls</li>
<li>ability to remove blocks</li>
<li>companion that follows you (commented out)</li>
<li>ability to place blocks (commented out)</li>

# Why we stopped
this game was developed during our sophomore / freshman year in high school, and schcool load inpaired our ability to get this project done.
